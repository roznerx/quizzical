# "Quizzical Project" for for "Learn React for free" course by Bob Ziroll 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Originally made in pure React, I decided to revisit this project a year later, now having almost 2 years of experience as a developer
- Refactored the whole code using Next.js, TypeScript and MUI, which are the tools I use on a daily basis in my current job
- The app is fully working and responsive
- Shout-out to the amazing Bob Ziroll and to Scrimba: this course is free and it made gain a lot of knowledge in React very quickly.

**NOTE:** tried setting up GitHub actions in order to display the app on GitHub Pages, but I cannot make it work. Will review this feature sooner or later.
